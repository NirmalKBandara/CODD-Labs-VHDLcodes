# Lab 6 – Arithmetic Unit
---

In this lab, we will design a 4-bit arithmetic unit that can add 2 numbers stored in registers. After completing the lab, you will be able to:

• `design and develop a 4-bit register`

• `design and develop a 4-bit arithmetic unit`

• `verify their functionality via simulation and on the development board`
