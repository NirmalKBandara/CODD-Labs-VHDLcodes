# 7-Segment Display
---

In this lab, we will design a 7-segment display for our 4-bit Arithmetic Unit developed in
previous lab. After completing the lab, you will be able to:

• `Design and develop a lookup table using Read Only Memory (ROM)`

• `Design and develop a 7-segment display using the output from the lookup table`

• `Verify and demonstrate their functionality via simulation and on the development`
board
